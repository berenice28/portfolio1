<h3> Projects </h3>

<p> I worked on Scatch. I created to mini video games. I created a game called "Under the Sea" 
  and I also created a Paddle Ball game. I also learned how to make list and shapes in python and scratch. Before 
  I could of done all this I first had to learn; variables:something to hold data ex:keeping score, functions: defining  step of steps
  witha set of parameters we can use multiple times,loops: repaeat taks and commands, if/then statements: are options if something
  happens and another action will. I also did an obamaicon project where I used my profile picture and changed it. 
  I used arduino to command robots to turn 360 degrees, make them go backwards and fowards, make them go along with music,
  create songs, and make an LED light turn on while all these events are happening.
